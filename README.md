<h1>Health and Human Services (HHS) Drupal Content Type Library: Leadership Bio</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
The Leadership Bio content type is used to create a reusable person content type for HHS leadership staff and contains fields for a portrait, biography, name, title and organization, degrees, and contact information. The use of this content type allows for consistent styling of all bios used on the website. 

<h2>Content Type Details</h2>
Contained in the /documentation folder are the content model for the Leadership Bio content type (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-LeadershipBio.xlsx) which includes the Drupal field names used and their matching schema.org metadata name; and a Word Template (HHS-Structured-Content-Type-Template-LeadershipBio.docx) which is a guidance document we provide to content owners to complete whenever they want a Leadership Bio to be created. The Template includes all of the fields that must be completed in order to create the Bio.
